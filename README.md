**Flutter Chatbot App with OpenAI API**

_This Flutter chatbot app allows users to have a conversation with an AI-powered chatbot using the OpenAI API._


**Features:**
- Users can send messages to the chatbot and receive responses.
- The chatbot uses OpenAI's powerful natural language processing capabilities to understand user input and generate responses.
- The chatbot's responses are displayed in a conversational format, with each message appearing in its own chat bubble.
- Users can scroll through the conversation history to review previous messages.



**Usage:**

To start a conversation with the chatbot, simply type a message in the text input field at the bottom of the screen and press the send button. The chatbot will generate a response based on the input and display it in a chat bubble above the text input field.
You can enter your Name and choose a cool looking Avatar.
You can scroll through the conversation history by swiping up and down on the screen.
